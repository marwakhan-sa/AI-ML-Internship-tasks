# AI-ML-Internship-tasks
This repository contains the tasks I completed for the DevelopersHub AI/ML Engineering Internship.

## Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset (Iris Dataset)

Objective: Load, inspect, and visualize the Iris dataset to understand trends and distributions.

Dataset: Iris (from seaborn)

Notebook: [Task1_Iris_Exploration.ipynb](./Task1_Iris_Exploration.ipynb)

Models/Tools: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib

Key results:
- Visualized feature relationships with scatter plots
- Examined distributions with histograms
- Identified outliers and spread with box plots
- Discovered that petal features best separate the species

More tasks coming soon...
