# AI-ML-Internship-tasks
This repository contains the tasks I completed for the DevelopersHub AI/ML Engineering Internship.

## Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset (Iris Dataset)

**Objective:** Load, inspect, and visualize the Iris dataset to understand trends and distributions.

**Dataset:** Iris (from seaborn)

**Notebook:** [Task1_Iris_Exploration.ipynb](./Task1_Iris_Exploration.ipynb)

**Models/Tools**: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib

**Key results**:
- Visualized feature relationships with scatter plots
- Examined distributions with histograms
- Identified outliers and spread with box plots
- Discovered that petal features best separate the species

## Task 2 – Predict Future Stock Prices (Short-Term)

**Objective**
Use historical stock data to predict the next day's closing price.

**Stock**  
Apple (AAPL)

**Notebook**  
[Task2_Stock_Prediction.ipynb](./Task2_Stock_Prediction.ipynb)

**Model**  
Linear Regression

**Key results**  
- Shows predicted vs real prices in a time-series plot  
- Captures general trend (though stock prediction is difficult)

## Task 6 – House Price Prediction

**Objective**  
Predict house prices using property features.

**Dataset**  
California Housing (scikit-learn)

**Notebook**  
[Task6_House_Price_Prediction.ipynb](./Task6_House_Price_Prediction.ipynb)

**Model**  
Linear Regression

**Key results**  
- Shows real vs predicted prices  
- Reasonable performance for a simple model  
- MAE and RMSE reported
